Hi, I'm Chris Yuan.

This is my personal tech blog, where I write about software engineering, DevOps, open source tools, and occasionally geopolitics and book reviews.

## About this site

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with a Terminal CSS aesthetic — monospace font, minimal design, and a retro terminal vibe. Previously hosted on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), now self-hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
